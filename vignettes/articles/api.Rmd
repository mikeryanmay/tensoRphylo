```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tensoRphylo)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# read the tree
tree <- ape::read.nexus(system.file("testdata", "extant_tree.nex", package = "tensoRphylo"))

# read character data
data <- readNexusData(system.file("testdata", "extant_data.nex", package = "tensoRphylo"))

# make the instance
tp <- makeTensorPhylo(tree, data)
```

# 1 Notation and data types

`tensoRphylo` is very particular about the types and sizes of arguments you provide.
Throughout this documentation I will use _data types_ as proxies for variables to make it clear what `tensoRphylo` expects.
I will indicate the data type and the package of origin as `package::type`.
I will also do this for return types (when assigning a result to an object) to make it clear what data types are generated by `tensoRphylo` objects.

When relevant, I will also provide an indication of the correct dimensionality of the object using parantheses.
The parantheses will contain comma-separate values that indicate the size of each dimension of the object.
For example, when I mean to indicate that an argument should be a single numeric value (a scalar), I will write `base::numeric(1)`.
When I mean that the argument should be a numeric vector, I will write `base::numeric(s)` to indicate a vector of length `s`.
When I mean that the argument should be a numeric matrix, I will write `base::matrix(r, c)`, where `n` indicates the number of rows and `c` indicates the number of columns.

The dimensions of many of the objects are determined by the number of tips in the tree or the number of states in the data matrix.
I will use `num_tips` as a proxy for the number of tips, and `num_states` as a proxy for the number of states.

# 2 Constructors

Create a `TensorPhyloInstance` with the `makeTensorPhylo`.
You _must_ provide a phylogeny, and also either: 1) a character dataset, or 2) the number of missing character states.
See the [Input](articles/dataformat.hmtl) for more details about data format.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create an instance with a tree and a character vector.
# supports ambiguity and missing data.
tp <- makeTensorPhylo(tree = ape::phylo,
                      data = base::character(num_tips))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create an instance with a tree and a numeric vector.
# does not support ambiguity or missing data.
tp <- makeTensorPhylo(tree = ape::phylo,
                      data = base::numeric(num_tips))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create an instance with a tree and a numeric matrix.
# supports ambiguity and missing data.
tp <- makeTensorPhylo(tree = ape::phylo,
                      data = base::matrix(num_tips, num_states))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create an instance with a tree but no data.
# create a missing character with `num_states` states.
tp <- makeTensorPhylo(tree       = ape::phylo,
                      num_states = base::numeric(1))
```

# 3 Computing probabilities

Compute the likelihood of the currently active model/parameters.
This includes the parameters of the diversification model, state-change model, and root frequency model, as well as the chosen conditional probability type.
These model components are described below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# compute the log likelihood
base::numeric(1) <- tp$computeLogLikelihood()
```

# 4 Lineage-specific diversification models

Lineage-specific diversification events occur independently among lineages, but can depend on the character state and/or time.
There are for types of events: speciation, extinction, sampling, and destructive sampling (simultaneous sampling and extinction).
Each type of event can occur according to one of four models: constant, state-dependent, time-dependent or time-and-state-dependent.
The type of model can be different for different types of events.

## 4.1 Time-dependent diversification models

The time-dependent models assume that rates are the same between discrete rate-change events.
The times of the rate-change events are measured backward in time, so that $t = 0$ is the present and $t > 0$ is some time in the past.
The times should be in ascending order, such that more recent events appear first.

A model with `n` rate-change times will have `n + 1` time intervals.
The last interval is "open" in the sense that it covers all time after the `n`<sup>th</sup> time point.
You will need to provide `n + 1` parameters (or sets of parameters), one per interval.
These should be ordered so that the first set of parameters corresponds to the first interval, the second corresponds to the second interval, etc.

## 4.2 Speciation events

During a speciation event, the affected lineage speciates, producing two new lineages.
If the model includes cladogenetic character change (see below), the lineage experiences cladogenetic evolution according to the cladogenetic process at that time; otherwise, the new lineages inherit the ancestor's state.
Speciation events are described by the parameter $\lambda$; the corresponding functions include `lambda` in their name.

```

# 5 Mass-diversification models

In contrast to lineage-specific-diversification events, mass-diversification events affect all lineages living at a given time.
There are four types of mass-diversification events: mass-speciation, mass-extinction, mass-sampling and mass-destructive-sampling.
Each event is associated with a magnitude, which is the probability that the event occurs to a given lineages.
These magnitude may be independent of the state of the lineage (a "constant" event), or it may be state-dependent.

Each mass-diversification event occurs at a particular time with a particular magnitude (or set of state-dependent magnitudes).
There can be multiple events of a given type, each with different event times.
The times of the events are measured backward in time, so that $t = 0$ is the present and $t > 0$ is some time in the past.
You should provide the times of the events in ascending order, such that more recent events appear first; the magnitudes should be ordered accordingly.

## 5.1 Mass-speciation events

Mass-speciation events are described by the parameter $\Upsilon$; the corresponding functions include `Upsilon` in their name.
During a mass-speciation event, all lineages alive at a given time have a chance of experiencing a speciation event with some probability.
If the model includes cladogenetic character change (see below), the speciating lineages experience cladogenetic evolution according to the cladogenetic process at that time; otherwise, both daughters inherit the ancestor's state.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-independent mass-speciation events at given times
mass_speciation_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_speciation_probability <- base::numeric(num_events)
tp$setUpsilonConstant(mass_speciation_times, mass_speciation_probability)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-dependent mass-speciation events at given times
mass_speciation_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_speciation_probability <- base::matrix(num_events, num_states)
tp$setUpsilonStateDependent(mass_speciation_times, mass_speciation_probability)
```

## 5.2 Mass-extinction events

Mass-extinction events are described by the parameter $\Gamma$; the corresponding functions include `Gamma` in their name.
During a mass-extinction event, all lineages alive at a given time have a chance of experiencing a extinction event with some probability.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-independent mass-extinction events at given times
mass_extinction_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_extinction_probability <- base::numeric(num_events)
tp$setGammaConstant(mass_extinction_times, mass_extinction_probability)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-dependent mass-extinction events at given times
mass_extinction_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_extinction_probability <- base::matrix(num_events, num_states)
tp$setGammaStateDependent(mass_extinction_times, mass_extinction_probability)
```

## 5.3 Mass-sampling events

Mass-sampling events are described by the parameter $R$; the corresponding functions include `Rho` in their name.
During a mass-sampling event, all lineages alive at a given time have a chance of experiencing a sampling event with some probability.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify a state-independent mass-sampling event at the present (t = 0)
mass_sampling_probability <- base::numeric(1)
tp$setRhoPresent(mass_sampling_probability)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify a state-dependent mass-sampling event at the present (t = 0)
mass_sampling_probability <- base::numeric(num_states)
tp$setRhoPresentStateDependent(mass_sampling_probability)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-independent mass-sampling events at given times
mass_sampling_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_sampling_probability <- base::numeric(num_events)
tp$setRhoConstant(mass_sampling_times, mass_sampling_probability)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-dependent mass-sampling events at given times
mass_sampling_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_sampling_probability <- base::matrix(num_events, num_states)
tp$setRhoStateDependent(mass_sampling_times, mass_sampling_probability)
```

## 5.4 Mass-destructive-sampling events

Mass-destructive-sampling events are described by the parameter $\Xi$; the corresponding functions include `Xi` in their name.
During a mass-descrutive0sampling event, all lineages alive at a given time have a chance of experiencing a destructive-sampling event (sampling and extinction) with some probability.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-independent mass-destructive-sampling events at given times
mass_destructive_sampling_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_destructive_sampling_probability <- base::numeric(num_events)
tp$setXiConstant(mass_destructive_sampling_times, 
                 mass_destructive_sampling_probability)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-dependent mass-sampling events at given times
mass_destructive_sampling_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_destructive_sampling_probability <- base::matrix(num_events, num_states)
tp$setXiStateDependent(mass_destructive_sampling_times, 
                       mass_destructive_sampling_probability)
```

# 6 State-change models

There are two types of state-change events: "anagenetic" events, which occur along lineages and are not associated with speciation events, and "cladogenetic" events, which are associated with speciation events.
Both types of events can occur according to two models: constant and time-dependent.

## 6.1 Time-dependent state-change models

The time-dependent models assume that state-change events are the same between discrete shift events.
The times of the shift events are measured backward in time, so that $t = 0$ is the present and $t > 0$ is some time in the past.
The times should be in ascending order, such that more recent events appear first.

A model with `n` shift events will have `n + 1` time intervals.
The last interval is "open" in the sense that it covers all time after the `n`<sup>th</sup> time point.
You will need to provide `n + 1` parameters (or sets of parameters), one per interval.
These should be ordered so that the first set of parameters corresponds to the first interval, the second corresponds to the second interval, etc.

## 6.2 Anagenetic events

During an anagenetic state-change event, a lineage changes from state _i_ to state _j_.
The rate at which these events occurs is described by a rate matrix, $H$ (denoted `Eta` in the functions below).
The rate at which a lineage in state _i_ changes to state _j_ is $\eta_{ij}$.
This rate matrix is analogous to the instantaneous-rate matrix, $Q$, used in standard continuous-time Markov models used to describe discrete-character evolution.
See the documentation for `tensoRphylo::RateMatrix` for more information about rate matrices.

### 6.2.1 Constant, symmetrical anagenetic events

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify constant-rate, symmetrical anagenetic process
transition_rate <- base::numeric(1)
tp$setEtaConstantEqual(transition_rate)
```

### 6.2.2 Constant, asymmetrical anagenetic events

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify constant-rate, asymmetrical anagenetic process
transition_matrix <- tensoRphylo::RateMatrix(num_states, num_states)
tp$setEtaConstantUnequal(transition_matrix)
```

### 6.2.3 Time-dependent, symmetrical anagenetic events

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify time-dependent, symmetrical anagenetic process
transition_change_times <- base::numeric(num_rate_shifts)
transition_rates        <- base::numeric(num_rate_shifts + 1)
tp$setEtaTimeDependentEqual(transition_change_times, transition_rates)
```

### 6.2.4 Time-dependent, asymmetrical anagenetic events

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify time-dependent, symmetrical anagenetic process
transition_change_times <- base::numeric(num_rate_shifts)
transition_matrix       <- tensoRphylo::RateMatrix(num_states, num_states)
transition_matrices     <- tensoRphylo::RateMatrixList(num_rate_shifts + 1)
tp$setEtaTimeDependentUnequal(transition_change_times, transition_matrices)
```

### 6.2.5 Mass-anagenetic events

A mass-anagenetic event occurs at a particular time, $t$; all lineages alive at time $t$ experience anagenetic change according to the probability matrix $Z$; $\zeta_{ij}$ is the probability that a lineage in state _i_ changes to state _j_ during the event.
See the documentation for `tensoRphylo::ProbabilityMatrix` for more information about probability matrices (and lists of probability matrices).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify mass-anagenetic events
mass_transition_times    <- base::numeric(num_transition_events)
mass_transition_matrix   <- tensoRphylo::ProbabilityMatrix(num_states, num_states)
mass_transition_matrices <- tensoRphylo::ProbabilityMatrixList(num_transition_events)
tp$setZeta(mass_transition_times, mass_transition_matrices)
```

### 6.2.6 Mass-extinction-and-anagensis events

We can model simultaneous mass-extinction and anagenetic character change.
To do so, we simply combine the mass-extinction and mass-anagenesis parameters, $\Gamma$ and $Z$.
You must provide one $Z$ matrix per mass-extinction event.
NOTE: We originally implemented mass-anagenetic events to accommodate changes in state associated with mass-extinction events.
Consequently, you cannot model mass-anagenetic events and mass-extinction-and-anagenesis events separately.
We intend to relax this dependence in the future.

In these examples, state-independent and state-dependent refers to the magnitudes of the mass-extinction events.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-independent mass-extinction-and-anagensis events at given times
mass_extinction_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_extinction_probability <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_transition_matrices    <- tensoRphylo::ProbabilityMatrixList(num_events)
tp$setGammaAndZetaConstant(mass_extinction_times, 
                           mass_extinction_probability,
                           mass_transition_matrices)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify state-dependent mass-extinction-and-anagensis events at given times
mass_extinction_times       <- base::numeric(num_events)
mass_extinction_probability <- base::matrix(num_events, num_states)
mass_transition_matrices    <- tensoRphylo::ProbabilityMatrixList(num_events)
tp$setGammaAndZetaStateDependent(mass_extinction_times, 
                                 mass_extinction_probability,
                                 mass_transition_matrices)
```

## 6.3 Cladogenetic events

During a cladogenetic state-change event, a lineage in state _i_ leaves one lineage in state _j_ and another lineage in state _k_.
In `tensoRphylo`, cladogenetic rates do not occur with a _rate_; rather, they occur with some probability whenever a speciation event occurs.
The probability that a lineage in state _i_ leaves one lineage in state _j_ and another in state _k_ is $\omega_{ijk}$.
We represent these probabilities in a three-dimensional array, $\Omega$ (denoted `Omega` below), where the first dimension corresponds to the ancestral state, the second dimension to the state of one daughter lineage, and the third dimension to the state of the second daughter lineage.
See the documentation for `tensoRphylo::CladoEvents` for more information about creating these arrays.

(Other software typically combines the speciation rate with the cladogenetic event probability.
For example, in `diversitree`, the rate at which a lineage in state _i_ speciates and produces one lineage in state _j_ and another in state _k_ is denoted $\lambda_{ijk}$.
The equivalent value in `tensoRphylo` is $\lambda_i \times \omega_{ijk}$.
We chose this alternative parameterization in `TensorPhylo` because it makes it more concise to express a non-cladogenetic model as a special case of a cladogenetic model.)

### 6.3.1 Constant cladogenetic events

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify constant-rate cladogenetic process
cladogenetic_array <- tensoRphylo::CladoEvents(num_states, 
                                               num_states, 
                                               num_states)
tp$setOmegaConstant(cladogenetic_array)
```

### 6.3.2 Time-dependent cladogenetic events

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify time-dependent cladogenetic process
cladogenetic_change_times <- base::numeric(num_rate_shifts)
cladogenetic_arrays <- tensoRphylo::CladoEventsList(num_rate_shifts + 1)
tp$setOmegaTimeDependent(cladogenetic_change_times, cladogenetic_arrays)
```

### 6.3.3 Mass-cladogenetic events

Because cladogenetic state-change events only occur at speciation events, mass-cladogenetic state-change events are not explicitly modeled.
Rather, they are _implied_ if you use a model with mass-speciation events and cladogenetic state changes.
When a lineage speciates during a mass-speciation event at time $t$, that lineage experiences cladogenetic state changes just as it would during a normal speciation event at that time (including any time-dependence in the cladogenetic state-change process).

# 7 Root prior models

The root prior parameter controls the probability that the tree begins in each possible state.
By default, we assume a flat root frequency prior.
However, you can also use a specified root frequency (_i.e._, something other than a uniform), or the quasistationary frequency.

## 7.1 Uniform root prior (default)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify uniform probability over all states at the beginning of the tree
tp$setRootPriorFlat()
```

## 7.2 Non-uniform root prior

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# specify probability distribution over all states at the beginning of the tree
tp$setRootPrior(base::numeric(num_states))
```

## 7.3 Quasistationary frequency prior

The quasistationary frequency is the frequency of lineages in each possible state after a long (infinite) period of time, taking into account differential diversification rates and the assumed state-change model (including both anagenesis and cladogenesis).

The quasistationary frequency assumes the tree evolves under a given process for an infinite amount of time (assuming it doesn't go extinct) but doesn't experience mass events of any type.
If you use this option, `TensorPhylo` will use the parameters at the beginning of the tree (the root or stem) to determine the quasistationary frequency.
Consequently, this option doesn't really make sense for models where the parameters changes over time, or when there are mass events of any type, because the process may not be quasi-stationary.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# tell tensorphylo to use the quasistationary frequency for the root prior
tp$setQuasistationaryFrequencyMode(TRUE)
```

You can also query the `TensorPhyloInstance` for its quasistationary frequency for the parameters at a particular time, $t$.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# check the quasistationary frequency of the parameters at a particular time
base::numeric(num_states) <- tp$getQuasiStationaryFrequency(base::numeric(1))
```

# 8 Conditional probabilities

Conditional probabilities represent ascertainment corrections induced by not studying some fraction of outcomes under the model.
For example, _conditioning on survival_ implies that we would not study trees that did not survive to the present.
The type of conditioning to use depends on whether the tree begins with 1 or 2 lineages, and how you choose to model sampling.
These options are discussed in more detail in the `tensoRphylo::conditionalProbability` documentation.

Conditional probability settings are implemented as named elements of the global `tensoRphylo::conditionalProbability` object.
To apply a particular correction, provide it to the `TensorPhyloInstance` like so:
```{r}
# condition the process on the two descendants of the root producing at least
# one extant descendant each. this is equivalent to conditioning on "survival"
# in most other software.
tp$setConditionalProbabilityType(conditionalProbability$ROOT_MRCA)
```

# 9 Stochastic mapping

## 9.1 Generate a sample of stochastic maps 

Simulate stochastic maps in `phytools` format.
This simulation can take a bit of time, but you can stop it early, returning the replicates that have completed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# simulate `reps` stochastic maps
phytools::multiSimmap(reps) <- tp$drawStochasticMaps(reps = base::numeric(1))
```

## 9.2 Simulate the average diversification rates per branch

This function computes the average diversification rate for each branch using stochastic mapping.
For each stochastic map, computes the diversification rate on each branch as the weighted average of the state-dependent diversification- and sampling-rate parameters.
Returns a list of matrices, each of which corresponds to the branch-specific (in rows) average diversification and sampling rates (columns).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# simulate `reps` branch rates
base::list<base::matrix(num_branches,5)>(reps) <- tp$drawBranchRates(reps = base::numeric(1))
```

The most general model includes lineage-specific diversification events (speciation, extinction, sampling, and destructive sampling), lineage-specific state-change events (either "anagenetically" along lineages, or "cladogenetically" at speciation events), as well as mass-diversification- and mass-state-change events (equivalent to lineage-specific events, but occurring to all lineages at a given time).
